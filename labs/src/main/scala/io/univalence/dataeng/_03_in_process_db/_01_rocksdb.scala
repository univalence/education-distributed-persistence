/**
 * =RocksDB=
 * Now, we will declare a store based on RocksDB. RocksDB is an
 * in-process database. It means that instead of launching a full
 * third-party service, as you use to do with databases, like Oracle,
 * PostgreSQL, Cassandra... RocksDB is just a library to manage data in
 * memory and files, that you add in your project dependencies. Its
 * lifecycle follows your application runtime.
 *
 * RocksDB is interesting because it manages data like most NoSQL
 * databases (Cassandra, BigTable, HBase...). It has features of a
 * key-value store, but also features of a time series database.
 *
 * RocksDB has first been created in Facebook offices and is now an open
 * source project. It is a fork of another in-process database named
 * LevelDB and made by Google developers. RocksDB is written in C++ and
 * comes with a Java wrapper.
 *
 * ==Data storage==
 * RocksDB almost follows the LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge-tree)
 * specifications. An '''LSM-tree''' is an organization of data between
 * the memory and mass storage, which is optimized for write accesses
 * (but less for read accesses), especially with huge volumes. In write
 * access, it is faster than B-Tree and B+Tree algorithm, used with more
 * traditional databases, knowing that such algorithms tend to fragment
 * intensively data with big amounts of data.
 *
 * Thus, RocksDb uses 3 kinds of data storage.
 *
 * {{{
 *     Data --+--> [Mutable Memtable]
 *             |      |
 *   MEMORY   |      +--> [Immutable Memtable]*
 *   =========|=============|=====================================
 *   VOLUME   |             +--> [SSTable & Index & Bloom filter]*
 *             +--> [WAL]
 * }}}
 *
 * ===Memtable===
 * The first storage is '''memtable'''. It is a memory area were data
 * are stored once they are put. RocksDB uses a skip list. Once the skip
 * list is full, it is converted first into an immutable skip list and
 * another mutable skip list is created. And when they are too many
 * immutable skip lists, they are stored in a SSTable.
 *
 * ===WAL===
 * The second kind of storage is the '''WAL''' (for ''Write Ahead
 * Log''). In parallel of the memtable, it also receives data once they
 * are put. The data are stored as is incrementally with no index. The
 * role of this file is only to rebuild the memtables that have not been
 * stored in SSTables, when you restart your application. The content of
 * the WAL is wipe out when the memtables are pushed to the SSTable.
 *
 * ===SSTable===
 * '''SSTable''' (''Sorted String Table'') is a file divided into
 * ''segments'' and each segment contains an __ordered__ subset of the
 * data. If you change a value in a record, RocksDB will rewrite the
 * whole segment at the end of the file.
 *
 * SSTable file comes with an __ordered__ index. Each index entry only
 * refers to the first position of the segment in the SSTable file. So,
 * it only refers the first record in the segment.
 *
 * {{{
 * INDEX        |      SSTABLE
 * -------------|--------------------------------------------
 * data       --|->    [data database delete deserialization]
 * codec      --|->    [codec couchbase encoder]
 * hashtable  --|->    [hashtable hbase immutable latency]
 * }}}
 *
 * So, if you search a specific key, you first have to look up for the
 * key equals or just below your key, to get the segment position. Then,
 * you find the corresponding entry in the segment by using a linear
 * search. In the figure above, if you search for the value `delete`,
 * you will use the key `data` and do the search in the segment
 * associated to `data`. If you search for `decoder`, it will be the
 * same: look up in the index and search in the associated segment. To
 * limit this kind of scenario, we use the Bloom filter, thast we will
 * in the section below.
 *
 * Regularly, you will need to clean the SStables. This automatically
 * done with a compaction job. This job is run on a regular basis. It
 * simply rebuild another SSTable file, from which it removes entries
 * marked as deleted and merges too small segments.
 *
 * The advantage of such structure is that it is fast and the index can
 * be loaded in memory even if you have a huge volume of data.
 *
 * In RocksDB, the index is saved in the same file as the SSTable file.
 * The compaction job is run in a separate thread every ~10 days.
 *
 * ===Bloom filter===
 * To improve data access, most key-value stores use a Bloom filter. A
 * '''Bloom filter''' is a structure with fixed size, that you feed when
 * you add new keys in a store. It can then tell if a key stored in the
 * file with more or less precision.
 *
 * {{{
 * Has this key K been registered?
 *
 *                   +--> YES (maybe)
 *   Bloom Filter --+
 *                   +--> NO  (absolutely)
 * }}}
 *
 * When you search a key, if the Bloom filter indicates that it does not
 * recognize it, then you the key is really not in your database and you
 * can tell that the key does not exist. If the Bloom filter answers
 * that the key is in the database, then the key may be in the database
 * (or not). In this case, you have to look up for the closest index and
 * scan the corresponding segment.
 *
 * The goal of the Bloom filter is to filter the search requests and
 * have some gain in read performances. RocksDB manages a Bloom filter
 * for every SSTable, it is stored in the SSTable file and load in
 * memory.
 *
 * ===Note===
 * RocksDB only sees data as byte arrays. So, you have to provide your
 * own codec to convert data.
 *
 * ==In this file==
 *   - We will start with a class that wraps the RocksDB API with the
 *     key-value store interface seen before.
 *   - You then have an exercise using this interface where you are
 *     asked to follow the evolution RocksDB files.
 *   - We then will leave the key-value store API to explore the time
 *     series capability of RocksDB.
 *   - A last part aims to understand the importance of key designing,
 *     when you have time series.

/**
 * =Time series=
 * Another interesting feature with RocksDB is its ability to store time
 * series. This ability comes with the capacity offered with skip list
 * and SSTables.
 *
 * '''Time series''' are just data evolving during time. It may
 * represent measures on an application (memory usage, CPU usage,
 * storage usage...) or on a computer (task manager, CPU temperature,
 * network I/Os...). It may also represent health data (heart beat rate
 * in a run, walk steps per day, sleep quality over a month...),
 * evolution of financial products (stocks, options, futures, forex...),
 * meteorological and climatic data...
 *
 * With time series, it is easier to follow the evolutions of indexes,
 * because time series are closed to continuous values (the notion of
 * ''continuous'' fully depends on the business domain). So, we use to
 * observe time series through graphs of different kinds, in a view to
 * have a better perception of series evolution.
 *
 * To query time series, you do not need to be precise. You just have to
 * provide the bounds (lower bound and upper bound) of an interval of
 * keys. In the case of RocksDB, such request results in an __iterator__
 * allowing you to explore ''lazily'' the values, whose key fits in the
 * described interval.
 *
 * ==Below==
 * There are two objects. The first one aims to store the memory heap
 * evolution of the current JVM during time, while filling a hash map.
 * The second one aims to explore those data, by using time series
 * capability of RocksDB.

 * =Key design with time series=
 * In this exercise, we want to know the user who has first checked in
 * each venue each day, based on data in the file
 * `data/foursquare/checkins.txt.gz`. In this objective, we need to
 * group the dataset by venueId and ordered them by the timestamp. But
 * we only have one key.
 *
 * ==Building the key==
 * In most NoSQL databases, keys follows two properties:
 *
 *   1. They are unique.
 *   1. They are ordered.
 *
 * In the dataset we want to explore, the ordered is ensured by the
 * timestamp and the uniqueness is ensured by the venueId and the
 * timestamp (two users cannot check in a location at the same time,
 * there is always a winner ;) ).
 *
 * The problem is that we have only one key. To tackle this limitation,
 * we will generate a key for each checkin based on two fields (venueId
 * and timestamp) to emulate a compound key. As RocksDB uses bitwise
 * order, the leftmost part of the key will contain the venueId and the
 * rightmost part will contain the timestamp. Timestamp must appeared in
 * the key as a readable string starting with the year, the month, the
 * day... The format [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601]]
 * is a perfect match for such usage. By convention, we use to separate
 * the different parts of the key with a character like `#`.
