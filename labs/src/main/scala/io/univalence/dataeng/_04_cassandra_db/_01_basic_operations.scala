/**
 * =Cassandra=
 * We saw in-process databases such as RocksDB and MapDB. However this
 * kind of databases doesn't scala when we need to deal with tons of
 * data.
 *
 * Cassandra is a column oriented, No SQL database with eventual
 * consistency. (meaning that they chose Availability and Partition
 * tolerance in the CAP theorem).
 *
 * Cassandra is design to handle a high volume of data by scaling using
 * multiple nodes with no single point of failure. Thus, it is design as
 * a multi master system and not a master/slave system. It means that
 * any nodes can die without impacting directly the system.
 *
 * Cassandra has first been created in Facebook offices and is now an
 * open source project under the Apache foundation. Cassandra is written
 * in C++ and comes with a Java wrapper.
 *
 * ==Concepts==
 * Cassandra is build around different concepts:
 *   - Keyspace: Configurations containing tables and defining how many
 *     times we should replicate the data for example.
 *   - Table: Defines the typed schema for a collection of partitions.
 *   - Partition:Defines the mandatory part of the primary key all rows
 *     in Cassandra must have to identify the node in a cluster where
 *     the row is stored.
 *   - Row: Collection of columns identifier by a primary key
 *   - Column: A single column with a type for example (name: String)
 *
 * ==Data storage==
 * Cassandra also uses the same data storage as RocksDB following the
 * LSM-tree for write heavy databases.
 *
 * ==Cassandra specificity==
 * Cassandra differ a lot from SQL database because it is query first.
 * It means that we design Cassandra table with queries in mind. Indeed
 * in Cassandra you can't join tables and you can query the data only
 * using the partition keys. If you need to query the same kind of data
 * in two different manners, they you denormalize the data and you
 * create two tables with different partition key.
 *
 * ==In this file==
 *   - The code is wrap around a TestContainer creating the Cassandra
 *     container to interact with.
 *   - You then have an exercise to interact with Cassandra.
